# Weather-Web-Application
In this project, I've shown a responsive weather app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Where, users can enter any city name to get the weather forecast or simply click on the "Use Current Location" button to get current location weather details, including temperature, wind speed, humidity, and more.
