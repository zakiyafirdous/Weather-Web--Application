# Weather-Web-Application
In this project, I've shown a responsive weather app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Where, users can enter any city name to get the weather forecast including temperature, wind speed, humidity, and more. 
This project will serve the following objectives: -  
1.	Provides the user with an easy and friendly interface  
2.	Provides the user with the temperature of a particular region  
3.	It will also show humidity, wind speed and cloud. 
Undoubtedly, weather forecasting has come a long way, helping people to know about weather conditions. So, if you are in an area where weather frequently changes from sunny to torrential rain in a matter of minutes, then what is the easiest way to make sure to be prepared? A suitable answer is a weather application.
